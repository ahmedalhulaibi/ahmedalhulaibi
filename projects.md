Nonoculus is a concept for a third person puzzle platformer that uses the keyboard and eye tracking as direct input.

Features:
- Camera control with eyes.
- "Telekinesis" with eyes.
- Slicing mechanic.
- Scripted areas require the user to close their eyes at which point platforms are revealed. 
- Game gives feedback when the eye tracker does not detect eyes, or when eyes are closed.

My main tasks included:
- Camera control with eyes
- Telekinesis with eyes
- Level Design


Technologies Used: C# and Unity
