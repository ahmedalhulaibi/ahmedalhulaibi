# Who am I?
My name is Ahmed Al-Hulaibi. 

I am a software developer based out of Toronto, Canada.

I'm currently working at the Bank of Nova Scotia as a developer supporting legacy COBOL and Java systems. 

My current project is enabling DevOps on the IBM Z/OS mainframe, defining and building a mainframe CI/CD pipeline. I'm also developing Bash and Perl scripts to automate and ease the on-boarding process for our development teams. The majority of our developers are not familiar with Unix or CLI so I am quite excited to see our teams take the plunge!
