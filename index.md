# Who am I?
My name is Ahmed Al-Hulaibi. 

I am a software developer based out of Toronto, Canada.

I'm currently working at the Bank of Nova Scotia as a developer. My current focus is supporting a legacy COBOL systems, in addition to SAS and Java systems. I am also working on enabling DevOps on the mainframe by developing Bash and Perl scripts to help automate and ease the on-boarding process for legacy developers, many of which have never used Unix!
