# Who am I?
My name is Ahmed Al-Hulaibi. 

I am a software developer based out of Toronto, Canada.

I'm currently working at the Bank of Nova Scotia as a developer. My primary role supporting legacy COBOL systems, in addition to Java systems. 

My secondary project is enabling DevOps on the IBM Z/OS mainframe. My role consists of defining and refining the mainframe CI/CD pipeline in addition to identifying and testing tools for mainframe DevOps. I'm also developing Bash and Perl scripts to automate and ease the on-boarding process for our application development and support groups. The majority of our developers are not familiar with Unix or CLI so I am quite excited to see our teams take the leap.
